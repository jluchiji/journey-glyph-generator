#Journey Glyph Generator
This is a program that generates glyphs that appear in the PS3 video game [Journey][1]. Here is an example of such glyphs generated by the program:

##How it works
Every glyph is composed of four symbols; sometimes they are rotated or flipped. The program has a number of such symbols programmed in `GlyphParts.txt`, and you can add or remove the stuff that you like/dislike. 

In case of manual editing, you pick your symbol, its color and outline. Then you manually specify rotation, flip and position. In case of random generation, everything mentioned above is done for you at random. Of course, you can still customize resulting glyph.

##About the code
I wrote this program out of boredom in the middle of a night. The code is ugly, obscure and unoptimized. Maybe I will clean it up, maybe I won't. However, the program does what it is supposed to do without crashing. Well, I suppose you can crash it if you try hard. Anyway, just simply have fun.

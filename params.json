{"name":"Journey Glyph Generator","tagline":"A program to make glyphs that appear in Journey.","body":"#Journey Glyph Generator\r\nThis is a program that generates glyphs that appear in the PS3 video game [Journey][1]. Here is an example of such glyphs generated by the program:\r\n\r\n![][2]\r\n\r\n##How it works\r\nEvery glyph is composed of four symbols; sometimes they are rotated or flipped. The program has a number of such symbols programmed in `GlyphParts.txt`, and you can add or remove the stuff that you like/dislike. \r\n\r\nIn case of manual editing, you pick your symbol, its color and outline. Then you manually specify rotation, flip and position. In case of random generation, everything mentioned above is done for you at random. Of course, you can still customize resulting glyph.\r\n\r\n##About the code\r\nI wrote this program out of boredom in the middle of a night. The code is ugly, obscure and unoptimized. Maybe I will clean it up, maybe I won't. However, the program does what it is supposed to do without crashing. Well, I suppose you can crash it if you try hard. Anyway, just simply have fun.\r\n\r\n##Hideous technical details\r\nEvery symbol is essentially a 3x3 boolean matrix, which makes each glyph a 9x9 matrix. \r\nGlyphs are generated from symbols defined in the `GlyphParts.txt`. Instructions on editing the file are in the file itself.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n###Journey Glyph Generator License\r\nCopyright Â© 2014 Aragorn Wyvernzora\r\n\r\n####Terms and Conditions\r\n- Permission is hereby granted to do **whatever you want** with the software and associated source code. \r\n- Do not involve me in anything you do with the software, unless you want to attribute, donate or contribute to the project.\r\n- I am not responsible for anything that has to do with the software, **use it at your own risk**.\r\n- **Have fun!**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [1]: http://thatgamecompany.com/games/journey/\r\n [2]: https://github.com/jluchiji/journey-glyph-generator/raw/master/composite.png","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
